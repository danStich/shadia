\arguments{
\item{nRuns}{The number of times that the
model will be run.}

\item{species}{Species for which the model will be
run. Current options include \code{'shad'} and
\code{'blueback'}.}

\item{nYears}{The number of years for which
each run will last. The default is 40 years
to match default FERC licenses, but can be 
changed.}

\item{timing}{The amount of time required for
upstream passage by individual fish (in days), 
where the default (1) indicates a 24-h dam
passage performance standard.}

\item{upstream}{A named list of upstream dam
passage efficiencies at each dam in the 
Saco River.

Users may specify a single value of upstream
passage at each dam, or a vector of upstream
passage efficiencies at each dam. Note that
passage efficiences passed as vectors are 
randomly sampled during each model run 
(not each year). Therefore, multiple model runs
are necessary if more than one passage efficiency
is supplied for any dam.}

\item{downstream}{A named list of downstream
dam passage efficiencies at each dam.

Users may specify a single value of downstream
passage at each dam, or a vector of downstream
passage efficiencies at each dam. Note that
passage efficiences passed as vectors are 
randomly sampled during each model run 
(not each year). Therefore, multiple model runs
are necessary if more than one passage efficiency
is supplied for any dam.}

\item{inRiverF}{Annual, recreational harvest of 
American shad. Parameterized as an annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{commercialF}{Commercial fishery mortality
for American shad in marine environment incurred 
through targeted fisheries. Parameterized as an 
annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{bycatchF}{Marine bycatch mortality of
American shad in non-target fisheries. 
Parameterized as an annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{indirect}{Indirect mortality incurred during
freshwater migration as a result of dam-related
impacts (e.g., injury, predation, etc.).}

\item{latent}{Latent mortality incurred during estuary
passage as a result of dam-related impacts (e.g., injury,
delay, etc.).}

\item{watershed}{A logical indicating whether or not
to use the same dam passage efficiencies at all dams
for upstream and downstream. If watershed = TRUE, then
the first element in lists `upstream` and `downstream`
are recycled for all subsequent dams.}

\section{Warning about serial execution and memory limits}{


Currently, internal functions rely on \code{list2env} to return
lists to a temporary environment created in the 
\code{sacoRiverModel} function. Consequently, lists 
that are exported must be limited in size. Therefore, 
users currently need to limit the number of runs per 
call (\code{nRuns} argument) to less than 10 or R will 
hit memory limits quickly. In reality, serial 
execution is prohibitively slow unless implemented 
using manual parallel processing (e.g., bash scripting).

In order to achieve a desired number of runs for a given
set of inputs, the recommended approach is to use 
parallel execution as demonstrated using snowfall in the
example below.
}

\examples{
# Parallel execution on a local cluster
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
\dontrun{
  
# R snowfall example

# Load R packages
  library(snowfall)
  library(rlecuyer)
  library(shadia)

# 1. Initialization of snowfall.
# -----  
# Initialize parallel mode using sockets and
# command-line args
  sfInit(parallel=TRUE, cpus=3, type="SOCK")

# Display information about nodes and processes
# used by this job. This is entirely optional,
# to demonstrate snowfall methods sfClusterCall()
# and sfCpus().

# Describe the nodes and cpus:
  cat(paste0('CPU count: ', sfCpus()), fill=TRUE)

# Count off each process with anonymous function
  cat('CPU ids: ', unlist(sfClusterCall(function() Sys.getpid())), fill=TRUE)

# 2. Load data. 
  data('fish')
  data('arr.B')
  data('arr.R')
  data('b.parms')
  data('r.parms')
  data('tempD')
  data('tempData_saco')

# 3. Define wrapper function, which can be called in parallel.
#
#   Runs sacoRiverModel() on each worker
#
#   Here, workerId just contains the identity of the cpu that perfomed
#   the work. We do this only to prove we have used all the specified cpus!
#   Ideally, we will minimize the data sent to (and returned from) the workers.
#
#   Note that constructing and returning a list enables the function to
#   return more than one output.
# -----
wrapper <- function(idx) {
  
  # Get cpu ids  
  workerId <- paste(Sys.info()[['nodename']],
                    Sys.getpid(),
                    sep='-'
  )

  return(retlist)
}
  
# 4. Export needed data to workers 
#    load required packages on workers.
  sfLibrary(shadia)

# 5. Start network random number generator 
#    (as "sample" uses random numbers).
#    sfClusterSetupRNG()

# 6. Distribute calculation to workers
  niterations <- 10
  start <- Sys.time()

  # Use sfLapply() function to send wrapper() to the workers:
    result <- sfLapply(1:niterations, wrapper) 
    
# 7. Stop snowfall
  Sys.time()-start  
  sfStop()

# 8. Examine the results returned from the cluster:

# 'result' is a list of lists. Save this:
  # save(result, file = "snowfall-result.rda")

# Extract results list from output list
  out <- lapply(result, function(x) x[[c('sim')]])

# Extract user inputs and population metrics
  res <- lapply(out, function(x) x[[c('res')]])
  resdf <- do.call(rbind, res)

# Extract sensitivity variables
  sens <- lapply(out, function(x) x[[c('sens')]])
  sensdf <- do.call(rbind, sens)

# Have a look at result  
  plot(resdf$year, resdf$populationSize)
