penobscotRiverModel(nRuns = 1, nYears = 50, timing = 1,
  upstream = list(milford = 1, howland = 1, westEnfield = 1, brownsMill = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{nRuns}{The number of times that the
model will be run.}

\item{nYears}{The number of years for which
each run will last. The default is 50 years
to match hydropower license duration in the
Penobscot River.}

\item{timing}{The amount of time required for
upstream passage by individual fish (in days), 
where the default (1) indicates a 24-h dam
passage performance standard.}

\item{upstream}{A named list of upstream dam
passage efficiencies at each dam in the 
Penobscot River. Stillwater and Orono dams are
not included in the list of values because all
fish reaching Orono Dam are trucked upstream.

Users may specify a single value of upstream
passage at each dam, or a vector of upstream
passage efficiencies at each dam. Note that
passage efficiences passed as vectors are 
randomly sampled during each model run 
(not each year). Therefore, multiple model runs
are necessary if more than one passage efficiency
is supplied for any dam.}

\item{downstream}{A named list of downstream
dam passage efficiencies at each dam in the 
Penobscot River (including Orono and Stillwater
dams). 

Users may specify a single value of downstream
passage at each dam, or a vector of downstream
passage efficiencies at each dam. Note that
passage efficiences passed as vectors are 
randomly sampled during each model run 
(not each year). Therefore, multiple model runs
are necessary if more than one passage efficiency
is supplied for any dam.}

\item{pinHarvest}{In-river, sustenance harvest
by Penobscot Indian Nation (PIN) upstream of Weldon 
Dam. Parameterized as an annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{inRiverF}{Annual, recreational harvest of 
American shad downstream of Weldon Dam. 
Parameterized as an annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{commercialF}{Commercial fishery mortality
for American shad in marine environment incurred 
through targeted fisheries. Parameterized as an 
annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{bycatchF}{Marine bycatch mortality of
American shad in non-target fisheries. 
Parameterized as an annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{indirect}{Indirect mortality incurred during
freshwater migration as a result of dam-related
impacts (e.g., injury, predation, etc.).}

\item{latent}{Latent mortality incurred during estuary
passage as a result of dam-related impacts (e.g., injury,
delay, etc.).}

\item{watershed}{A logical indicating whether or not
to use the same dam passage efficiencies at all dams
for upstream and downstream. If watershed = TRUE, then
the first element in lists `upstream` and `downstream`
are recycled for all subsequent dams.}
}

inputs and available model outputs for each use that 
contains \code{nRuns} x \code{nYears} number of rows.

# R snowfall example

# 1. Initialization of snowfall.
# -----  
# Initialize parallel mode using sockets and
# command-line args
sfInit(parallel=TRUE, cpus=3, type="SOCK")

# Display information about nodes and processes
# used by this job. This is entirely optional,
# to demonstrate snowfall methods sfClusterCall()
# and sfCpus().

# Describe the nodes and cpus:
cat(paste0('CPU count: ', sfCpus()), fill=TRUE)

# Count off each process with anonymous function
cat('CPU ids: ', unlist(sfClusterCall(function() Sys.getpid())), fill=TRUE)

# 2. Load data. 
# -----
data('fish')
data('arr.B')
data('arr.R')
data('tempD')
data('tempData')

# 3. Define wrapper function, which can be called in parallel.
#
#   Runs PenobscotRiverModel.R on each worker
#
#   Here, workerId just contains the identity of the cpu that perfomed
#   the work. We do this only to prove we have used all the specified cpus!
#   Ideally, we will minimize the data sent to (and returned from) the workers.
#
#   Note that constructing and returning a list enables the function to
#   return more than one output.
# -----
wrapper <- function(idx) {

# Get cpu ids  
  workerId <- paste(Sys.info()[['nodename']],
                    Sys.getpid(),

                    )

# Run the model
  res1 <- penobscotRiverModel(nYears = 50)
  
# Define the output lists
    retlist <- list(
      worker=workerId,  # Worker id for now
      res=res1)       
    
    return(retlist)
}

# 4. Export needed data to workers 
#    load required packages on workers.
# -----
sfLibrary(shadia)

# 5. Start network random number generator 
#    (as "sample" uses random numbers).
# -----
sfClusterSetupRNG()

# 6. Distribute calculation to workers
# -----
niterations <- 10
start <- Sys.time()

# The magic is in snowfall's sfLapply() function,
# which sends wrapper() out to the
# workers:
result <- sfLapply(1:niterations, wrapper) 

Sys.time()-start

# 7. Stop snowfall
# -----
sfStop()

# 8. Examine the results returned from the cluster:
# -----

# 'result' is a list of lists. Save this:
save(result, file = "snowfall-result.rda")

# pull out coef vector from the list, and summarize
# its descriptive statistics, mean, etc.:
res <- lapply(result, function(x) x[[c('res')]])
resdf <- do.call(rbind, res)
}
