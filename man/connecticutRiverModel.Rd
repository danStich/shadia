\arguments{
\item{nRuns}{The number of times that the
model will be run.}

\item{species}{Species for which the model will be
run. Current options include American \code{'shad'} and
\code{'blueback'} herring.}

\item{nYears}{The number of years for which
each run will last. The default is 40 years
to match default FERC license duration.}

\item{n_adults}{Number of starting adults in 
population.}

\item{timing}{A list. The amount of time required for
upstream passage by individual fish (in days),
where the default, list(1,1,1,1,1), indicates a 24-h dam
passage performance standard.}

\item{upstream}{A named list of upstream dam
passage efficiencies at each dam in the
Connecticut River.

Users may specify a single value of upstream
passage at each dam, or a vector of upstream
passage efficiencies at each dam. Note that
passage efficiences passed as vectors are
randomly sampled during each model run
(not each year). Therefore, multiple model runs
are necessary if more than one passage efficiency
is supplied for any dam.}

\item{downstream}{A named list of downstream
dam passage efficiencies at each dam in the
Connecticut River.

Users may specify a single value of downstream
passage at each dam, or a vector of downstream
passage efficiencies at each dam. Note that
passage efficiences passed as vectors are
randomly sampled during each model run
(not each year). Therefore, multiple model runs
are necessary if more than one passage efficiency
is supplied for any dam.}

\item{downstream_juv}{A named list of downstream
dam passage efficiencies at each dam in the 
Connecticut River for juveniles.}

\item{northfield}{Annual take for juveniles and
adults from PU IV and PU V at the Northfield
Mountain pumped power storage facility.}

\item{pSpillway}{Probability of using the spillway
route for passage through the Turner's Falls
hydropower complex.}

\item{inRiverF}{Annual, recreational harvest in river. 
Parameterized as an annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{commercialF}{Commercial fishery mortality
in marine environment incurred through targeted 
fisheries. Parameterized as an annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{bycatchF}{Marine bycatch mortality of
species in non-target fisheries. 
Parameterized as an annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{indirect}{Indirect mortality incurred during
freshwater migration as a result of dam-related
impacts (e.g., injury, predation, etc.).}

\item{latent}{Latent mortality incurred during estuary
passage as a result of dam-related impacts (e.g., injury,
delay, etc.).}

\item{watershed}{A logical indicating whether or not
to use the same dam passage efficiencies at all dams
for upstream and downstream. If watershed = TRUE, then
the first element in lists `upstream`, `downstream`,
and `downstream_juv` are recycled for all subsequent dams.}

\item{k_method}{Method used to impose carrying capacity. The 
default, `cumulative`, assumes that carrying capacity is based on 
all available habitat through the most upstream occupied production 
units in a given migration route. The alternative, 'discrete' assumes
that carrying capacity is applied within discrete production units 
based on the numbers, and was the method used in Stich et al. (2019).}

\item{sensitivity}{Whether to return a dataframe for sensitivity
analysis. The default is set to FALSE for faster run time and smaller
memory load in parallel processing.}
}

Returns a dataframe when sensitivity = FALSE (default). 
Returns a list of two named dataframes when sensitivity = TRUE.
The first dataframe (\code{res}) contains user-defined
inputs and available model outputs. The second dataframe (\code{sens})

\section{Production units by migration route}{

For the Connecticut River, PUs are invariant
by path because of the layout of the hydro-complex
at Turners Falls

  \item Connecticut River
    \itemize{
      \item \code{PU I} Downstream of Holyoke
      \item \code{PU II} Holyoke to Turner's Falls
      \item \code{PU III} Canal

      \item \code{PU V} Vernon Dam to Bellow's Falls
   }

\section{Warning about serial execution and memory limits}{

Current implementation is based on work
in press, and is thus subject to modification
without notice.

Currently, internal functions rely on \code{list2env} to return
lists to a temporary environment created in the
\code{connecticutRiverModel} function. Consequently, lists
that are exported must be limited in size. Therefore,
users currently need to limit the number of runs per
call (\code{nRuns} argument) to less than 10 or R will
hit memory limits quickly. In reality, serial
execution is prohibitively slow unless implemented
using manual parallel processing (e.g., bash scripting).

In order to achieve a desired number of runs for a given
set of inputs, the recommended approach is to use
parallel execution as demonstrated using snowfall in the
example at the bottom of this page.
}

\examples{
# Parallel execution on a local cluster
\dontrun{
  
# R snowfall example

# Load R packages
  library(snowfall)
  library(rlecuyer)
  library(shadia)
  library(plyr)

# 1. Initialization of snowfall.
# Initialize parallel mode using sockets
  sfInit(parallel=TRUE, cpus=3, type="SOCK")

# Display information about nodes and processes
# used by this job. This is entirely optional,
# to demonstrate snowfall methods sfClusterCall()
# and sfCpus().

# Describe the nodes and cpus:
cat(paste0('CPU count: ', sfCpus()), fill=TRUE)

# Count off each process with anonymous function
cat('CPU ids: ', unlist(sfClusterCall(function() Sys.getpid())), fill=TRUE)

# 2. Load data. 
data('fish')
data('arr.B')
data('arr.R')
data('b.parms')
data('r.parms')
data('tempD')
data('tempData_connecticut')

# 3. Define wrapper function, which can be called in parallel.
#
#   Runs connecticutRiverModel() on each worker
#
#   Here, workerId just contains the identity of the cpu that perfomed
#   the work. We do this only to prove we have used all the specified cpus!
#   Ideally, we will minimize the data sent to (and returned from) the workers.
#
#   Note that constructing and returning a list enables the function to
#   return more than one output.
wrapper <- function(idx) {

# Get cpu ids  
  workerId <- paste(Sys.info()[['nodename']],
                    Sys.getpid(),
                    sep='-'
                    )

# Run the model

# 4. Export needed data to workers 
#    load required packages on workers.
  sfLibrary(shadia)

# 5. Start network random number generator 
#    (as "sample" uses random numbers).
#    sfClusterSetupRNG()

# 6. Distribute calculation to workers
  niterations <- 10
  start <- Sys.time()

  # Use sfLapply() function to send wrapper() to the workers:
    result <- sfLapply(1:niterations, wrapper) 
    
# 7. Stop snowfall
  Sys.time()-start  
  sfStop()

# 8. Examine the results returned from the cluster:

# 'result' is a list of lists. Save this:
# save(result, file = "snowfall-result.rda")

# Extract results list from output list
  out <- lapply(result, function(x) x[[c('sim')]])

# Extract user inputs and population metrics
  res <- lapply(out, function(x) x[[c('res')]])
  resdf <- do.call(rbind, res)

# Extract sensitivity variables
  sens <- lapply(out, function(x) x[[c('sens')]])
  sensdf <- do.call(rbind, sens)

# Have a look at result  
  plotter <- ddply(resdf, 'year', summarize,
                   mu=mean(populationSize))
  plot(plotter$year, plotter$mu, type = 'l')
