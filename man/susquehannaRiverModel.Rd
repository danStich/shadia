\arguments{
\item{nRuns}{The number of times that the
model will be run.}

\item{species}{Species for which the model will be
run. Current options include American \code{'shad'} and
\code{'blueback'} herring.}

\item{nYears}{The number of years for which
each run will last. The default is 40 years
to match default FERC license duration.}

\item{n_adults}{Number of starting adults in
population.}

\item{p_JuniataUp}{Proportion of fish using Juniata River.
Default = 0.21 based on proportional distribution of habitat.
Must sum to 1.00 with others.}

\item{p_WestBranchUp}{Proportion of fish using West Branch River.
Default = 0.22 based on proportional distribution of habitat.
Must sum to 1.00 with others.}

\item{p_ChemungUp}{Proportion of fish using Chemung River.
Default = 0.27 based on proportional distribution of habitat.
Must sum to 1.00 with others.}

\item{p_NorthBranchUp}{Proportion of fish using North Branch Susquehanna River.
Default = 0.30 based on proportional distribution of habitat.
Must sum to 1.00 with others.}

\item{timing}{The amount of time required for
upstream passage by individual fish (in days),
where the default (1) indicates a 24-h dam
passage performance standard and the value is
specified as a proportion of 1 day.}

\item{upstream}{A named list of upstream dam
passage efficiencies at each dam in the
Susquehanna River. Passable dams currently are
not included in the list of values.

Users may specify a single value of upstream
passage at each dam, or a vector of upstream
passage efficiencies at each dam. Note that
passage efficiencies passed as vectors are
randomly sampled during each model run
(not each year). Therefore, multiple model runs
are necessary if more than one passage efficiency
is supplied for any dam.}

\item{downstream}{A named list of downstream
dam passage efficiencies at each dam in the
Susquehanna River.

Users may specify a single value of downstream
passage at each dam, or a vector of downstream
passage efficiencies at each dam. Note that
passage efficiencies passed as vectors are
randomly sampled during each model run
(not each year). Therefore, multiple model runs
are necessary if more than one passage efficiency
is supplied for any dam.}

\item{downstream_juv}{A named list of downstream
dam passage efficiencies at each dam in the
Susquehanna River for juveniles.}

\item{inRiverF}{Annual, recreational harvest in river.
Parameterized as an annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{commercialF}{Commercial fishery mortality
in marine environment incurred through targeted
fisheries. Parameterized as an annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{bycatchF}{Marine bycatch mortality of
species in non-target fisheries.
Parameterized as an annual rate [0, 1].}

\item{indirect}{Indirect mortality incurred during
freshwater migration as a result of dam-related
impacts (e.g., injury, predation, etc.).}

\item{latent}{Latent mortality incurred during estuary
passage as a result of dam-related impacts (e.g., injury,
delay, etc.).}

\item{watershed}{A logical indicating whether or not
to use the same dam passage efficiencies at all dams
for upstream and downstream. If watershed = TRUE, then
the first element in lists `upstream`, `downstream`,
and `downstream_juv` are recycled for all subsequent dams.}

\item{k_method}{Method used to impose carrying capacity. The
default, `cumulative`, assumes that carrying capacity is based on
all available habitat through the most upstream occupied production
units in a given migration route. The alternative, 'discrete' assumes
that carrying capacity is applied within discrete production units
based on the numbers, and was the method used in Stich et al. (2019).}

\item{sensitivity}{Whether to return a dataframe for sensitivity
analysis. The default is set to FALSE for faster run time and smaller
memory load in parallel processing.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe when sensitivity = FALSE (default).
Returns a list of two named dataframes when sensitivity = TRUE.
The first dataframe (\code{res}) contains user-defined
inputs and available model outputs. The second dataframe (\code{sens})

\section{Warning about serial execution and memory limits}{


Currently, internal functions rely on \code{list2env} to return
lists to a temporary environment created in the
\code{susquehannaRiverModel} function. Consequently, lists
that are exported must be limited in size. Therefore,
users currently need to limit the number of runs per
call (\code{nRuns} argument) to less than 10 or R will
hit memory limits quickly. In reality, serial
execution is prohibitively slow unless implemented
using manual parallel processing (e.g., bash scripting).

In order to achieve a desired number of runs for a given
set of inputs, the recommended approach is to use
parallel execution as demonstrated using snowfall in the
example below.

# Load R packages

model <- function(x) {

  # Run the model
  sim <- susquehannaRiverModel(nYears = 40, species = "shad")

  # Output
  return(sim)
}

# Export  libraries or data to workers
sfLibrary(shadia)

# Distribute calculation to workers
niterations <- 30

# Use sfLapply() to distribute simulations to workers
# and run the model with these settings in parallel
result <- sfLapply(1:niterations, model)
